This project is a simple implementation of ray tracing in Java. It demonstrates how rays can be traced in a 3D space to detect intersections with spheres and render the scene using a basic canvas.

Project Structure Main.java: The main program that initializes the Buffered Img, sets up the scene, and performs ray tracing. Setup Instructions Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later. IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode) to edit the code. Running the Project:

Clone the repository or copy the source code into your local project. Compile the Java files:
```
cd src
javac Main.java
```
Run the Main class:
