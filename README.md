# Computer Graphics Projects
This repository contains a collection of computer graphics projects focusing on ray tracing techniques. The projects are implemented in Java and GLSL, offering both a traditional programming approach and a shader-based approach to rendering.

## Projects
### RaytracerJava
Overview:
A ray tracer implemented in Java that demonstrates classic ray tracing techniques. This project covers fundamentals such as:

Basic geometric primitives (spheres, planes, etc.)
Lighting and shading models
Reflection and shadow calculations
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
Java JDK 8 or above.
Building & Running:
Compile the source code using your preferred Java IDE or via the command line.
Run the main class to see the ray tracing output.
### ShaderToyRayTracer
Overview:
A ray tracer implemented using GLSL, designed to run on ShaderToy or any compatible environment. This project leverages GPU shaders to achieve real-time rendering effects.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
A system supporting OpenGL 3.3 or higher.
Familiarity with GLSL and shader programming.
Running the Shader:
Upload the shader code to ShaderToy (or a similar platform) to view and interact with the ray traced scene.
